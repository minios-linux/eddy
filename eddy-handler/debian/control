Description: Eddy Handler for package updates.
 Eddy Handler is a utility designed to update the package database
 before installing packages with Eddy. It checks if the package cache
 is older than a day or does not exist, and if so, it updates the
 package database. After the update, Eddy is launched for package
 installation.
